        <p>Subject to the epidemic development and the need for infection control, the Government will delineate restricted areas and make a <mark><strong>restriction-testing declaration</strong></mark>. Persons within the areas are required to <u>stay in their premises and undergo compulsory testing</u> in accordance with the arrangement by the Government, and can only leave after the relevant test results are mostly ascertained. All premises within the restricted areas, whether or not confirmed cases were found therein, would be included in the compulsory testing notice. <u>Any person who had been present in the restricted area for more than two hours in the past 7 days have to also undergo compulsory testing.</u></p>

        <h2>Additions</h2>
        <p>Persons who have tested positive in the past three months do not need to undergo compulsory testing. For those who need to undergo compulsory testing, they must undergo nucleic acid tests in accordance with relevant compulsory testing notices and cannot use RATs to fulfil the requirement of such notices. In other words, <u>a negative RAT result cannot be deemed as fulfilling the compulsory testing requirement.</u></p>
        <p>Furthermore, unless a person subject to compulsory testing has obtained a medical certificate proving that he or she is unfit to undergo testing using a sample taken through a "throat swab" because of health reasons, the person cannot provide a deep throat saliva sample to fulfil the compulsory testing requirement.</p>
        <p>Persons subject to compulsory testing in accordance with a compulsory testing notice must undergo <u>professional swab sampling at any of the ad-hoc mobile specimen collection stations, CTCs/CTSs or recognised local medical testing institutions</u> in order to fulfil the requirements for compulsory testing.</p>
        <p>Young children may continue to undergo the test using a stool specimen.</p>

            <li>Long waiting time</li>
            <li>Hurried arrangement <br>(e.g. opening hour of sample collect and mobile testing point overlap general working hour, people do not have time to go)</li>
            <li>Frequency is too high</li>
